# js-wizard
A simple Wizard built entirely with Vanilla JS

## What we want to acheive

Create a simple wizard component that allows the user to steps through pages of content.

**Features can include:**

- Step Page - Title, SubTitle and Content
- Simple Back/Next Navigation buttons to handle change between steps
- Define multiple steps
- (Optional) Prevent the user navigating to the next page until the form has been completed.
